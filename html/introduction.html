            <p class="contentParagraph">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
                designed to handle everything from small to very large projects
                with speed and efficiency.</p>
            <p class="contentParagraph">
                Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
                performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
                and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
                staging areas, and multiple workflows.</p>

            <h1 class="contentTitle">A short History of git</h1>
            <p class="contentParagraph">As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction
                and fiery controversy.</p>
            <p class="contentParagraph">The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope.
                For most of the lifetime of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes
                to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002,
                the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</p>
            <p class="contentParagraph">In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux
                kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down,
                and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux
                development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux)
                to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while
                using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:</p>
            <p class="contentParagraph">
            <ul class="listItems">
                <li><a class="contentParagraph">Speed</a></li>
                <li><a class="contentParagraph">Simple design</a></li>
                <li><a class="contentParagraph">Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</a></li>
                <li><a class="contentParagraph">Fully distributed</a></li>
                <li><a class="contentParagraph">Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="contentParagraph">Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and
                yet retain these initial qualities. It’s incredibly fast, it’s very efficient with large
                projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear
                development (See Git Branching).</p>

            <h1 class="contentTitle">Understanding git</h1>

            <p class="contentParagraph">
                The conclusion I draw from this blog is that you can only really use Git
                if you understand how Git works. Merely memorizing which commands
                you should run at what times will work in the short run, but it’s only a
                matter of time before you get stuck or, worse, break something.
            </p>
            <p class="contentParagraph">
                Half of the existing resources on Git, unfortunately, take just that approach:
                they walk you through which commands to run when, and expect that you
                should do fine if you just mimic those commands. The other half does go
                through all the concepts, but from what I have seen, they explain Git in a
                manner that assumes you already understand how Git works.
            </p>
            <p class="contentParagraph">
                This tutorial, will take a conceptual approach to Git. My goal will be, first
                and foremost, to explain the Git universe and its objectives, and secondarily
                to illustrate how to use Git commands to manipulate that universe.
            <p class="contentParagraph">
                - I will begin by describing the Git data model, the repository.

                - From there I will describe the various operations Git provides for manipulating
                the repository, starting from the simplest (adding data to a repository) and
                moving through the more complex operations of branching and merging.

                - I will then discuss how to use Git in a collaborative setting.

                - Finally I will look at the Git rebase function, which provides an alternative
                to merging, and consider its pros and cons.
