        <p class="contentParagraph">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
            designed to handle everything from small to very large projects
            with speed and efficiency.</p>
        <p class="contentParagraph">
            Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
            performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
            and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
            staging areas, and multiple workflows.</p>

        <h1 class="contentTitle">A short History of git</h1>
        <p class="contentParagraph">As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction
            and fiery controversy.</p>
        <p class="contentParagraph">The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope.
            For most of the lifetime of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes
            to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002,
            the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</p>
        <p class="contentParagraph">In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux
            kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down,
            and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux
            development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux)
            to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while
            using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:</p>
        <p class="contentParagraph">Speed
            - Simple design
            - Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
            - Fully distributed
            - Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</p>
        <p class="contentParagraph">Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and
            yet retain these initial qualities. It’s incredibly fast, it’s very efficient with large
            projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear
            development (See Git Branching).</p>
