                <p>First time I met with Git, was when I started programming android apps,
                    but all I was doing was commiting to master not a single pull or merge.
                    As a matter effect I actually didn’t even know how Git would actually help
                    me. I was just feeling good when I commit and GitHub showed that little
                    green square, which shows how activly you are programming/commiting.
                    But that was all.<br><br>

                    But when I start working as real Android developer in company called
                    Beenius. They were using Git quite differentlyas I was used to it. So I
                    was forced to learn git and using it as offen as possible. So I decided to
                    make a blog as a cheat sheet for me and you coderz.<br><br>

                    So enjoy reading, and I hope that I helped you at least with some
                    definitions and my personal documentation
